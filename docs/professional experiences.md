# Professional Experiences

### Machine Learning Engineer @FreddieMac

* Built machine learning model for multi class classification of documents such as credit verification, Assets and debts and Income for single family forecasting system 
* Leveraged AWS Textract (OCR) for text extraction service, built a custom classifier using AWS comprehend for entity detection(semantics) and document classification. 
* Developed micro services using flask for building machine learning pipeline for interaction between different AWS frameworks for asynchronous flow of data and improved the performance of the machine learning pipeline from 6 hours to 15 minutes 

<sub>*(Mar 2020 – Sep 2020)*<sub>

### Machine Learning Engineer @FannieMea

* Developed ML model for Borrower Default Risk Assessment, which improved operational efficiency for lenders. and built a pipeline to process of data from various sources to identify fraud or detect defects ("Anomaly Detection Automation").
* Designed and orchestrated machine learning pipeline which receives inputs from multiple SQL databases and flat files from Linux system.

<sub>*(Sep 2019 – Feb 2020)*<sub>

### Machine Learning Researcher @Krasnow Institue of Advanced Study.

* Built k-means Cluster detection machine learning model for physiological parameters dataset of a biological neuron, which helped identify feature importance used on random forest classifier. These patterns helped to improve recall of the model by 70%.
* Optimized genetic machine learning algorithm (Covariance matrix evolutionary strategy) to fit computational models.
* Automated Machine learning data pipeline to cluster different neuron. Reduced testing time by 63% and improved analysis accuracy.

<sub>*(Feb 2018 - May 2019)*<sub>


### Senior Python Developer @Accenture
* Designed and implemented a multinomial logistic classifier model using Spark and MLlib to predict customer credit performance.
* Feature engineered to provide a recommendation on customer-focused rewards programs, which improved customer satisfaction index by 4%.
* Improved load time of a python automation application framework by 40%. In the old application the entire folder tree loaded for every tab switch. The solution is to load only the elements that are selected.
* Implemented Django RESTful services for a multinomial logistic classifier model on Apache Spark to predict customer credit performance.
* Improved load time of a python automation application framework by 40 by tweaking component

<sub>*(Nov 2015 - May 2017)*<sub>

### Big Data Engineer @Tata Consultancy Service

* Replicated Statistical Analytical Software models on Hadoop cluster which were battle-tested for performance improvement on hive data warehouse. Scaled models on Hadoop which were 40% faster.
* Designed and implemented Flask rest service for insurance lead management for AIG Insurance.

##### Health insurance policy fraud analysis.
* Implemented streaming data pipeline system on Hadoop clusters to predict insurance claim trends, which helped Business to detect policies which are more prone to fraud.
* Designed and implemented automation tool to schedule jobs on a mainframe system which was done manually. This tool evaded manually errors and saved 80% of the developer’s productivity time.
* Lead a team of 2 junior developers to automate hive table verification test cases which saved tester time by 40%.

##### Loan Approval Prediction (XGBOOST, Random Forest, Spark)
* Pre-processed by removing outliers, univariant and bivariant analysis on features. Built a XGBoost and Random Forest predictive models to assess loan approval rate.
* Helped sales representatives to guide customers to have hassle free loan approval process.
* Provided predictive model as a service for the agencies. This improved the sales of the loan products.

##### Credit Card Fraud (Anomaly Detection)
* Developed a Deep Neural Network model using SMOTE oversampling technique to solve the data imbalance, which significantly reduced the Type II error in the data.
* Built machine learning models such as Random forest and Decision tree to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not and estimated the performance of the model using precision and recall.

##### Automated credit collection system
* Designed and Implemented application programming interfaces to meet credit card collection bucketing system. Which contributed to   overall performance of the tool.
